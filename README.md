# Census-UK

Every ten years, the United Kingdom undertakes a census of the population, with the most recent one having been conducted in 2021. 
The purpose of such a census is to compare different people across the nation and to provide the government with accurate statistics of the population to enable better planning,
to develop policies, and to allocate certain funding. 

In this project, a mock census of an imaginary modest townwas provided. 
The task was to be considered as part of a local government team who will be making decisions on what to do with an unoccupied plot of land and what to invest in.
